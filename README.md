How To Get The Job?

I need to know that you have the required skills and that we we can work well together before I can hire you. Please have a look at the below link. If you can solve the discussed issue you fit my criteria. What you need to do is this: solve the below issue and send me the solution.

Here is the problem to solve - if you know the solution it's really simple and fast:

You need to set up an Azure account, create a blob storage container and then replace the hardcoded values in my code with your information. You don't need to add any UI/UX. Just store a file (call it 'picture.jpeg') in the container you created and assign it access tier 'Archive'. You can store the file via the Azure portal - no need to write an upload component. Then you need to change the pages/api/azureApi.js file to do the following:

Copy the file "picture.jpeg' (see code const blobName) using Azure's REST API and store a new file in the same container (call it 'picturecopy.jpeg'; see code const targetBlobName) with access tier 'Cool'. The original file ('picture.jpeg') has to remain in the container unmodified with the unchanged access tier 'Archive' (it cannot be deleted at any point).

By clicking the 'RUN API' button in the index.js the API should execute the above procedure.

Once done, you can upload the code to a public Git and send me a link. I can then evaluate what you did. 

Looking forward to working with you.

Thanks,
Andres
